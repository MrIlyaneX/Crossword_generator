# Crossword Generator

This Python program implements an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) for generating crosswords from a given set of words.
The Evolutionary Algorithm is designed to evolve and improve crossword solutions over generations.

## Features

- **Word Input:** Provide a input#.txt (number instead of #) in inputs folder, program will read all files, if its naming in ascending order.
The solutions will be placed in outputs directory.
  
- **Evolutionary Algorithm:** The program utilizes an evolutionary approach to iteratively improve the crossword solutions over generations.

- **Genetic Operators:** The EA incorporates genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation to create diverse and optimized crossword layouts.

## Dependencies

Used only Python 3.11+
